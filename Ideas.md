- Connection to the calendar
- Connection to sports api to get the latest matches live (most common usage for minor football league)
- Integrated live actions:
    - Timer (for sports such as cout the time of a lap or a match, or to count time for a respiratory exercise, or just a timer)
    - Live score (for sports such as football, basketball, etc.)
